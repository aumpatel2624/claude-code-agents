description: Initialize the full multi-agent pipeline (explore-on-diet-coke → pipeline-announcer). Runs without asking for confirmation.
---

Claude, you must immediately begin pipeline initialization.

Run the following agents in this exact order:

1. explore-on-diet-coke  
   - Explore the entire project folder  
   - Determine project type (frontend/backend/full-stack)  
   - Generate /project-context/context.xml  
   - Finish with the message: "Project context initialized."

2. pipeline-announcer  
   - Announce and enforce the full multi-agent architecture  
   - Declare startup agents, routing rules, and worker agent restrictions  
   - Finish with the message: "Pipeline initialized."

Do not ask the user for confirmation.
Do not pause.
Do not request additional information.

Begin initialization now.
